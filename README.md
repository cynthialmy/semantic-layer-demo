# Metric Trust Explorer

A semantic layer demo that illustrates why defining metrics once matters at enterprise scale.

**🌐 Live Demo:** [https://semantic-layer-demo.streamlit.app/](https://semantic-layer-demo.streamlit.app/)

## Overview

This Streamlit app demonstrates how different source systems (VGS, VPC, SI+) compute the same procurement metrics differently, and how a governed semantic layer provides a single source of truth.

## Features

- **Three conflicting source systems**: Each system computes metrics with different logic, filters, and data sources
- **Governed metric definitions**: YAML-based metric definitions that serve as the semantic layer
- **Visual lineage**: Graphviz diagrams showing how metrics are computed from source systems
- **Business impact simulation**: Demonstrates how metric inconsistencies lead to different business decisions

## Metrics Demonstrated

1. **Supplier On-Time Delivery Rate**: Shows how VGS excludes partial deliveries while SI+ counts them, leading to different percentages
2. **Negotiated Savings**: Illustrates how VGS uses prior contract price while VPC uses list price, producing inflated savings
3. **Active Contract Value**: Demonstrates how VGS includes amendments while VPC shows original value only

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/cynthialmy/semantic-layer-demo.git
cd semantic-layer-demo

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Note: On some systems, you may need to install Graphviz system library:
# macOS: brew install graphviz
# Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install graphviz
# Windows: Download from https://graphviz.org/download/

# Generate synthetic data
python3 data/generate_data.py

# Run the app
streamlit run app.py
```

## Deployment

**Live Application:** [https://semantic-layer-demo.streamlit.app/](https://semantic-layer-demo.streamlit.app/)

The app is deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud. To deploy your own version:

1. Push to GitHub repository `cynthialmy/semantic-layer-demo`
2. Connect to Streamlit Cloud
3. Set the main file path to `app.py`
4. The app will automatically install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
